						“Domo Gasoline Corporation Ltd. Has dealt with MobileTek Consulting since 2003 for supply and service of our office computers and software.  
						During this time, we have found their service to be very professional and their products to be of the highest standard and quality.  Their advice and recommendations on matters related to our data processing systems are always in the best interests of our company.  
						I would have no hesitation in recommending MobileTek Consulting for the supply and service of computer equipment and software.”

						“I discovered Jason and his company through a referral several years ago.  He has helped me upgrade my computer to one of his machines, fixed our laptop from home, helped set me up with good antivirus protection, 
						helped me figure out a problem that none of the techies at Manitoba Health could solve even though the problem was at their end, and is now setting me up with a new laptop.  He and his employees are always helpful on the phone or in person, 
						and the work is done quickly and given back problem free.  I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them to anyone!“

						“I have worked with Jason and his crew for a number of years and appreciate their thoughtful attention. Quick to respond, caring about their clients, they always do their very best to provide excellent service. 
						Jason speaks “low tech” for those of us who don’t always understand “geek”. I particularly appreciate that they don’t try to sell me something I don’t really need. Have fun with the new business name… I know you will continue with the old level of service.”

						"I started using A+ computers about 3 years ago. I used to purchase products from Dell, and while their on line service was ok, they would only service what I bought, or charge an enormous fee. 
						I discovered MobileTek (now A+) and have not looked back and have not considered another service provider since. I have purchased 3 new computers and am looking at a 4th, as we’ll as higher efficiency printers. A+ has also networked my home office – everything is integrated, and backups run seamlessly. 
						I can print documents while working on my laptop and watching TV. A+ service is excellent …. They response quickly and complete services faster than anyone I have previously used. I would and do recommend A+ for home, home office and small/medium sized businesses.”
