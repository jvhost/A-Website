				<h3>Against the grain…</h3>
				<p>Computer troubles can be an awful ordeal. Why should the repair process be just as bad? 
				Many computer companies are focused on the wrong details
				– customer service is often a low priority and client-expectations have declined as a result.
				</p>
				<p>At A+ Computers & Services, we believe that the repair process can, 
				and should, be a more positive one; much like when an experienced friend helps you out of a jam. 
				Most of our clients have sent their friends and family our way when they’ve experienced difficulties. 
				They know that we have a reputation for providing high-quality parts and services. They know that we're in the business of "helping people", 
				not "selling computers". They also know that it's hard to find that kind of service anywhere else.
				</p>

				<h3>Reactive, Proactive, Elite</h3>
				<h4>The break-fix model is dead.</h4> <p>More and more businesses are recognizing the role that proactive monitoring and 
				maintenance plays in avoiding costly disruptions to business-critical services.</p>
              <p>But even businesses that truly comprehend the costs and consequences associated with downtime and security breaches, 
			  may fail to implement the necessary policies and procedures to maintain the health, security and compliance of their networks. 
			  This may be an indication that they don't have a sufficiently qualified IT administrator, that their IT staff are overburdened, 
			  or that they lack the required tools or knowledge.</p>
			  <p>Businesses of all sizes have some very similar needs. 
			  Your team needs ongoing access to company resources, the tools that allow them to work effectively, 
			  and perhaps a certain amount of technical support. Your data must be kept secure at all times and backed up regularly. 
			  Software must be routinely patched and updated and your users and computers must be protected from online threats.</p>
			  <p>Obviously, it will take a certain amount of resources to achieve these goals. 
			  Businesses may eventually hire an in-house IT administrator whose time is devoted exclusively to these tasks. 
			  But what can you do if you're not yet ready to take that plunge? The solution is an A+ Managed Services Plan. 
			  In fact, if you have an IT Administrator, our programs are so cost-effective, you should ask them how much more productive 
			  they could be if we were to free them from many of their more mundane and repetitive tasks.</p>
			  <p>Utilizing the advantages of the best, modern, purpose-built software, our team will proactively monitor and maintain your network remotely, 
			  24/7/365. We can help reduce risk, improve user satisfaction and productivity, and increase profitability.</p>
			  <p>We'll provide you with regular weekly reports and onsite visits at least once per month. 
			  Our help desk will be available to support your team 24 hours per day and the professional knowledge and 
			  experience of our entire team will be at your disposal for upgrades, special projects or any emergencies that may crop up.</p>
			  <p>In addition to giving you peace of mind and freedom from responsibility, our unlimited plans are backed up by a 100% uptime guarantee. 
			  That's right - if you experience any downtime at all, you don't pay. What are you waiting for?</p>

				<h3>VIRUS is a dirty word.</h3>
				<p>Its mere mention causes home users and network administrators alike to wince. 
				It’s like the electronic equivalent of a home invasion.</p>
				<p>A computer virus, much like its medical counterpart, can cause SERIOUS trouble and must be dealt with IMMEDIATELY.</p>
				<h4>If you believe that your computer may be infected, please follow these important steps:</h4>
				<h5>EMERGENCY MEASURES</h5>
				<p>1. Disconnect your network cable. Knowingly allowing an infected computer to communicate with the rest of the world is like sitting quietly by 
				the phone while a perpetrator systematically breaks into all of the homes on your block. Be a good neighbour.</P>
				<p>2.Shut down your computer. Once a virus infects your computer, 
				things will usually go from bad to worse very quickly. Don’t place your data (and your wallet) at further risk.</p>
				<p>3. Call for help. If you knew enough to solve your own problem, it’s unlikely you’d be reading this.</p>
				</br>
				<h5 style="color:#c4161c">WARNINGS:</h5>
				<p>• DO NOT ATTEMPT A SYSTEM RECOVERY OR SYSTEM RESTORE. A system restore is not likely to solve your problem. A SYSTEM RECOVERY MAY CAUSE LOSS OF DATA.</p>
				<p>• It is unwise to proceed at this point without a full data backup. Get help.</p>
				<p>• DO NOT ATTEMPT YOUR OWN BACKUP WITH AN EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE OR MEMORY STICK. A virus may spread to your external device as well. 
				If an infected external storage device is re-connected after your computer has been cleaned, you run the risk of re-infecting your entire system.</p>
				<p>• Be very careful where you take your computer! Many “Computer Repair Services” do not consider that your data may be highly valuable to you.</p>
				<p>• If you are completely confident that you have a full and current backup of your data… you may want to run a scan with your installed security software. 
				However, be aware that your security software’s ability to detect threats may have been compromised already. If, 
				after running a scan, you still suspect a problem, get help. In most cases, 
				a single security package will not completely remove all of the malicious software from your computer. Left alone, 
				infected files can soon take over and re-infect your entire system.</p>
