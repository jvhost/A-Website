							<p>Jason prefers people over technology, but only slightly. In his personal time, he enjoys downhill skiing, competitive sailing and also martial arts, so pay your bills on time! He loves finding creative ways of solving problems through the application of modern technology. 
							In 2003 he co-founded MobileTek Consulting, which evolved into A+ Computers & Services. He also co-founded Megabase Solutions in 2012 with the goal of making Canadian small businesses more efficient.</p>

							In December of 2014 he began learning to play piano and he has impeccable taste in music.  He loves pizza – who doesn’t, right? – but we recommend that you avoid feeding him after midnight.</p>

							We are very fortunate he agreed to join our team in 2007. Jeff is the most senior of our technical staff and, as such, he’s entitled to open all of the new boxes – he takes this matter very seriously and insists that the term is, in fact, “R&D”.
							In more recent news, he’s become the bearer of the company stick and carrot – although we suspect the carrot may have perished when the fridge was left unplugged. Jeff also coaches his son’s minor hockey team because he’s allowed to use his outside voice. </p>

						"I started using A+ computers about 3 years ago. I used to purchase products from Dell, and while their on line service was ok, they would only service what I bought, or charge an enormous fee. I discovered MobileTek (now A+) and have not looked back and have not considered another service provider since. 
						I have purchased 3 new computers and am looking at a 4th, as we’ll as higher efficiency printers. A+ has also networked my home office – everything is integrated, and backups run seamlessly. I can print documents while working on my laptop and watching TV. A+ service is excellent …. They response quickly and complete services faster than anyone I have previously used.
